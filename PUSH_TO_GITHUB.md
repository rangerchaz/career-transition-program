## 🚀 Push to GitHub

Run this command to push everything:

### If using HTTPS (recommended):
You'll need a **Personal Access Token** instead of your password.

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Career Transition Platform")
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Generate token and copy it
6. When prompted for password, paste the token

### Alternative: Use SSH

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:rangerchaz/career-transition-program.git
git push -u origin main
```

(Requires SSH key setup: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
